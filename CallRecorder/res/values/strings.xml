IF IT DOES NOT WORK ON YOUR PHONE AT ALL
OR IT DOES NOT RECORD OPPOSITE SIDE VOICE CLEARLY:
1. Try to mix different recording settings as it described here: http://clevermobile.net/products/call-recorder/call-recorder-settings-configuration-instructions/
2. There is a limitation for some phones that do not support recording from phone line or bluetooth. It is audio driver problem made by manufacturer of the phone. List of known supported devices and configurations for them is here: http://clevermobile.net/products/call-recorder/call-recorder-supported-phones-and-configurations-for-them/
Please, not give bad marks for that. Thank you!
